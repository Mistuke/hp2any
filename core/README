Testing:

1. Go to the test directory and compile tester.
2. Load Profiling.Heap.Read into ghci.
3. Change to the dir that contains the cabal file (you should be
   already there if you performed the second step from Emacs).
4. Now you can try test{1,2,3} as you please. You might want to delete
   test/tester.hp between tests.
